# Holochain + GraphQL Starter Kit

Can't wait for official GraphQL support? Get started right away with this example app thanks to the power of WASM!

## About

While official Holochain support for GraphQL is coming it is still some time away. By compiling the Rust GraphQL server Juniper and exposing a single zome function `graphql` we can create a zome that acts as a distributed graphql server.

At the moment there is a fair bit of boilerplate code required. Entities must be defined twice, once as a holochain entry and once as a graphql object. There are plans for a macro that creates both from a single declaration.
